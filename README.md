# Tropical invertebrate community assembly processes are robust to a gradient of land use intensity

Overview of R scripts:

Main_community-assembly: Calculate stochasticity metrics (NST, MST and NTP) and community assembly processes (iCAMP) at each sample site for each taxonomic group.

Main_figure1: Use betaregression to assess effect of logging on stochasticity metrics, and plot figure 1.

Main_figure2 Use Dirichlet regression to assess effect of logging on community assembly processes, and plot figure 2.

Main_generalists-specialists: Compare stochasticity metrics between trophic generalists and trophic specialists.

Supp_sensitivity-analysis: Sensitivity analysis for sample sizes for spiders, Orthoptera and moths (supplementary text).

Supp_community-similarity: Calculate Bray-Curtis similarity of each logged site to old-growth forest (figure S2).

Supp_sample-size: Plot figure S1 which shows sample sizes at each site for each taxonomic group. 

Supp_species-richness: Compare species richness among taxa and across the logging gradient. Plot figures S3 and S4.
