# Stochastic dispersal assembly dominates tropical invertebrate community assembly regardless of land use intensity

Overview of R scripts:

Main_community_assembly: Calculate stochasticity metrics (NST, MST and NTP) and community assembly processes (iCAMP) at each sample site for each taxonomic group

Main_figure1: Use betaregression to assess affect of logging on stochasticity metrics, and plot figure 2

Main_figure2 Use Dirichlet regression to assess affect of logging on community assembly processes, and plot figure 2

Main_generalists_specialists: Compare stochasticity metrics between generalist and specialists taxa

Supp_sensitivity_analysis: Sensitivity analysis for sample sizes for spiders, Orthoptera and moths (supplementary text)

Supp_community_similarity: Calculate Bray-Curtis similarity of each logged site to old-growth forest for each taxonomic group (supplementary figure 2)

Supp_sample_size: Plot supplementary figure 1 which shows sample sizes at each site for each taxonomic group.
